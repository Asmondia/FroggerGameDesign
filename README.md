# Frogger
 
 Frogger game that was made for a University assignment. Contains 3 different power ups, achievements and an infinitely generating level. 
 This was the first time making a game with knowledge of specific game design patterns and one of the first times of using Unity. 
 The project was well recieved by the people that marked it and it scored very highly.
 Since finishing the course I have updated way collision detection worked within the game based of methods I now know in Unity from personal projects, as well as changed the level generation to stop large sections of one type of terrain.
